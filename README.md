# design_Servo_and_DC_motor
in this repository three different designs for three different circuits.

## Servo Motor Knob
in this design we connected arduino with circuit that connected to servo motor by start the simulation we can move the potentiometer and the servo motor will move with it you can see it in the servo motor knob moving.

### servo motor knob code
here you can see the code we use to connect the arduino with the servo motor.

## Servo Motor Sweep
in this design we connected arduino with circuit that connected to servo motor by start the simulation the servo motor will move as it programmed you can see it in the servo motor sweep moving.

## DC Motor
in this design we connected arduino with circuit that connected to DC motor by start the simulation the DC motor will start to move as it programmed.

### DC motor code
here you can see the code we use to connect the arduino with the DC motor.
